## Welcome to the Wails v3 Technical Documentation

This section is **not** about community guidelines or how to open a pull-request.
Instead, it dives into **how Wails v3 is built** so that you can quickly orient
yourself in the codebase and start hacking with confidence.

Whether you plan to patch the runtime, extend the CLI, craft new templates, or
simply understand the internals, the pages that follow provide the technical
context you need.

## High-Level Architecture

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Go Backend" icon="seti:go">
    The heart of every Wails app is Go code compiled into a native executable.
    It owns application logic, system integration and performance-critical
    operations.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Web Frontend" icon="seti:html">
    UI is written with standard web tech (React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla, …)
    rendered by a lightweight system WebView (WebKit on Linux/macOS, WebView2 on
    Windows).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bridging Layer" icon="puzzle">
    A zero-copy, in-memory bridge enables **Go⇄JavaScript** calls with automatic
    type conversion, event propagation and error forwarding.
  </Card>

  <Card title="CLI & Tooling" icon="terminal">
    `wails3` orchestrates project creation, live-reload dev server, asset
    bundling, cross-compilation and packaging (deb, rpm, AppImage, msi, dmg…).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What This Documentation Covers

| Topic | Why It Matters |
| ----- | -------------- |
| **Codebase Layout** | Map of `/v3` directories and how modules interact. |
| **Runtime Internals** | Window management, system APIs, message processor, and platform shims. |
| **Asset & Dev Server** | How web assets are served in dev and embedded in production. |
| **Build & Packaging Pipeline** | Taskfile-based workflow, cross-platform compilation, and installer generation. |
| **Binding System** | Static analysis pipeline that generates type-safe Go⇄TS bindings. |
| **Template System** | Generator architecture that powers `wails init -t <framework>`. |
| **Testing & CI** | Unit/integration test harness, GitHub Actions, race detector guidance. |
| **Extending Wails** | Adding services, templates, or CLI sub-commands. |

Each subsequent page drills into these areas with concrete code samples,
diagrams, and references to the relevant source files.

:::note
Prerequisites: You should be comfortable with **Go 1.23+**, basic TypeScript,
and modern frontend build tools. If you are new to Go, consider skimming the
official tour first.

Happy exploring — and welcome to the Wails v3 internals!
